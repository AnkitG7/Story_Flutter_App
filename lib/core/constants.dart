const String descriptionRocket =
    '''Rocket technology has been critical to space exploration. Rockets are used to launch satellites, astronauts, and probes into space. They are also used to propel spacecraft on interplanetary journeys. Rockets are essentially engines that create thrust by expelling gas at high speeds out of a nozzle. The rocket's fuel is stored in tanks that are mounted on the rocket's structure. The tanks are pressurized to force the fuel into the engine's combustion chamber, where it is ignited to create the thrust necessary to lift off the ground.

Space agencies around the world use rockets to explore the universe. NASA's Saturn V rocket, which launched the Apollo missions to the Moon, is one of the most famous rockets in history. The European Space Agency's Ariane 5 rocket is used to launch satellites and spacecraft into orbit. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket has been used to send cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station. The development of reusable rockets has the potential to drastically reduce the cost of spaceflight, making it more accessible to private companies and individuals. The future of space travel will depend on continued advancements in rocket technology.

Rocket propulsion has been instrumental in the advancement of space exploration. Rockets are powered by chemical reactions that create a high-velocity exhaust, which propels the rocket forward. The rocket's size and shape are designed to maximize thrust and minimize drag. Rockets are capable of traveling at incredible speeds, reaching escape velocity and entering orbit around Earth. They are also used to explore other planets and celestial bodies.

Space agencies like NASA and SpaceX continue to develop rockets for space exploration. The next generation of rockets, such as NASA's Space Launch System, will be more powerful and capable of carrying larger payloads into space. Private companies are also investing in rocket technology, with SpaceX planning to send humans to Mars. Advances in rocket technology have the potential to transform our understanding of the universe and the role humans play in it. Rockets are a crucial part of our future in space.''';

As we continue to explore space, we will gain a deeper understanding of the universe and our place in it.

Space travel is not without its challenges. Spacecraft must be designed to withstand the harsh conditions of space, including extreme temperatures, radiation, and vacuum. Space agencies are also tasked with developing technology that can safely transport humans to and from space. Despite these challenges, the rewards of space travel are immense. The exploration of space has given us a greater appreciation for the complexity and beauty of the universe. As we continue to push the boundaries of space exploration, we will unlock new discoveries and advance our understanding of the universe.''';

const String descriptionYeah =
    '''Yeah, the moment after traveling to space is a truly unforgettable experience. Astronauts describe a profound sense of awe and wonder as they look down on Earth from above. The view of our planet from space is a humbling reminder of our place in the universe. The absence of gravity also gives astronauts a unique sense of freedom and weightlessness.

Space agencies like NASA and SpaceX have made it possible for humans to experience the yeah moment of traveling to space. The development of spacecraft like SpaceX's Crew Dragon and NASA's Orion have made space travel safer and more accessible than ever before.

    """A gentleman was walking through an elephant camp, and he spotted that the elephants weren’t being kept in cages or held by the use of chains.

All that was holding them back from escaping the camp, was a small piece of rope tied to one of their legs.

As the man gazed upon the elephants, he was completely confused as to why the elephants didn’t just use their strength to break the rope and escape the camp. They could easily have done so, but instead, they didn’t try to at all.

Curious and wanting to know the answer, he asked a trainer nearby why the elephants were just standing there and never tried to escape.

The trainer replied;

 

“when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.”

 

The only reason that the elephants weren’t breaking free and escaping from the camp was that over time they adopted the belief that it just wasn’t possible.

No matter how much the world tries to hold you back, always continue with the belief that what you want to achieve is possible. Believing you can become successful is the most important step in actually achieving it.""";

    """In a small Italian town, hundreds of years ago, a small business owner owed a large sum of money to a loan-shark. The loan-shark was a very old, unattractive looking guy that just so happened to fancy the business owner’s daughter.

He decided to offer the businessman a deal that would completely wipe out the debt he owed him. However, the catch was that we would only wipe out the debt if he could marry the businessman’s daughter.

Needless to say, this proposal was met with a look of disgust.

The loan-shark said that he would place two pebbles into a bag, one white and one black.

The daughter would then have to reach into the bag and pick out a pebble. If it was black, the debt would be wiped, but the loan-shark would then marry her. If it was white, the debt would also be wiped, but the daughter wouldn’t have to marry the loan-shark.

Standing on a pebble-strewn path in the businessman’s garden, the loan-shark bent over and picked up two pebbles.

Whilst he was picking them up, the daughter noticed that he’d picked up two black pebbles and placed them both into the bag.

He then asked the daughter to reach into the bag and pick one.

The daughter naturally had three choices as to what she could have done:

Refuse to pick a pebble from the bag.
Take both pebbles out of the bag and expose the loan-shark for cheating.
Pick a pebble from the bag fully well knowing it was black and sacrifice herself for her father’s freedom.
She drew out a pebble from the bag, and before looking at it ‘accidentally’ dropped it into the midst of the other pebbles. She said to the loan-shark;

 

“Oh, how clumsy of me. Never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.”

 

The pebble left in the bag is obviously black, and seeing as the loan-shark didn’t want to be exposed, he had to play along as if the pebble the daughter dropped was white, and clear her father’s debt.
